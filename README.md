# Installation / Execution

This project was developed for play on Arduboy, an Arduino Leonardo with Gameboy-like controls. To deploy and play the project, open the galagaScroll.ino file in the Arduino IDE. Next, ensure the Arduino IDE is properly configured for deployment to an Arduboy (instructions [here](https://arduboy.com/download-and-learn-arduino/)). Of special note is that the Arduboy2 and ArduboyTones libraries must be installed for the program to compile correctly.

When the file is properly deployed to the Arduboy, the game should start automatically. To play, press A or B to start the game. The player ship is controlled with the d-pad and photons are fired by pressing A or B. The game ends as soon as the player ship collides with an enemy ship, at which point your score will be displayed and another game can be started by pressing A or B when prompted.
